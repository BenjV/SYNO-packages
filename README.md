# SYNO-packages
The SickChill and Medusa packages are just wrappers around the official package from their githubs.  
So these are not different applications but just all the stuf needed to make Synology package for them.  

The sources are:  
https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa  
https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill  

During installation they do a git fetch from those githubs.  
Both packages needs Git and Python3.  
Python3 can be from the SynoCommunity(3 or 3.8) or from Synology
